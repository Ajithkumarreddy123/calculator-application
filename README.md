# üîã Power Calculator using Python on AWS

This project provides a simple and efficient Power Calculator built using Python, deployed and run on AWS services. It allows users to calculate the result of raising a number (base) to the power of another (exponent), supporting both positive and negative exponents, including decimals.

---

## üöÄ Overview

The Power Calculator is designed as a beginner-friendly project that demonstrates clean code structure, modularity, and testability in Python. It supports both command-line interaction and an optional graphical user interface (GUI), and it is deployed on AWS for scalability and ease of use.

## üß∞ Technologies Used

- **Python** ‚Äì Core language for implementation  
- **AWS Lambda** ‚Äì For serverless compute tasks  
- **AWS API Gateway** ‚Äì For exposing the power calculator as a web service  
- **AWS S3** ‚Äì For storing input data or results (optional)  
- **AWS CloudWatch** ‚Äì For monitoring and logging  
- **PyTest** ‚Äì For unit testing the calculation logic

## üîß Setup and Usage

### 1. Prerequisites

- AWS account with access to Lambda, API Gateway, and CloudWatch
- Python 3.x installed on your local system
- AWS CLI installed and configured with your credentials  
- `pip` for installing packages (if needed)  
- `pytest` for running tests locally

### 2. Deployment on AWS

1. **Deploy Lambda function:**
    - Create a new Lambda function in AWS Management Console.
    - Upload the Python script for the power calculator.
    - Set the Lambda function's execution role permissions.

2. **Set up API Gateway:**
    - Create a new API in AWS API Gateway.
    - Configure an endpoint for invoking the Lambda function.
    - Enable CORS for web access if necessary.

3. **CloudWatch Setup (Optional):**
    - Enable CloudWatch logs for your Lambda function to monitor activity.

4. **Run the Application:**
    - Use the AWS API Gateway URL to interact with the deployed Power Calculator via an HTTP request.
